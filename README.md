A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that follows the
[simple app state management
tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple).

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

We're using `flutter_localizations` package which generates code automatically based on `lib/src/localization/*.arb` language files.

## Supporting new languages

To add another language to the app:

1. add a `app_xx.arb` where _xx_ is a two letter language code (eg. pl for Polish, es for Spanish). It must contain translated strings for all keys from `app_en.arb` (except ones with a `@` prefix, those are for added context for the translator),
2. add new supported Locale to `supportedLocales` list in `lib/app.dart` (eg. Locale('pl', '') for Polish, Locale('es', '') for Spanish).

## Using defined strings

After code generation all of the defined strings will be available for widgets from `AppLocalizations.of(context)`.
Eg. to read an `appTitle` field in the Text widget: `Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.appTitle)`.

### Testing with `AppLocalizations`

If a widget to test uses `AppLocalizations`, you will have to wrap it with `MaterialApp` and provide `localizationsDelegates: AppLocalizations.delegate` like so:

```dart
const myWidget = MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: [
    AppLocalizations.delegate,
  ],
  home: TestWidget(),
);
```
