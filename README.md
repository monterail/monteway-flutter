## üëã Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that follows the
[simple app state management
tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple).

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## üì¶ Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

### Native splash screen

Splash screen configuration with available options is available in `flutter_native_splash.yaml`.
Any changes to this file have to be followed by running `flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create` command.

> This is a solution for masking the initial load time of Flutter engine. If the app does
> something time consuming before displaying meaningful content to the user consider
> adding a splash screen widget to mask such wait time.

## üåç Localization

We're using `flutter_localizations` package which generates code automatically based on `lib/src/localization/*.arb` language files.

### Supporting new languages

To add another language to the app:

1. add a `app_xx.arb` where _xx_ is a two letter language code (eg. pl for Polish, es for Spanish). It must contain translated strings for all keys from `app_en.arb` (except ones with a `@` prefix, those are for added context for the translator),
2. add new supported Locale to `supportedLocales` list in `lib/app.dart` (eg. `Locale('pl', '')` for Polish, `Locale('es', '')` for Spanish).

### Using defined strings

After code generation all of the defined strings will be available for widgets from `AppLocalizations.of(context)`.
Eg. to read an `appTitle` field in the Text widget: `Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.appTitle)`.

#### Testing with `AppLocalizations`

If a widget to test uses `AppLocalizations`, you will have to wrap it with `MaterialApp` and provide `localizationsDelegates: AppLocalizations.delegate` like so:

```dart
const myWidget = MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: [
    AppLocalizations.delegate,
  ],
  home: TestWidget(),
);
```

## üíÖ Code style

It's good to keep consistent code style, at least project-wide, and Dart/Flutter does come with linting support.

### Linting

We're using `flutter_lints` package which contains recommended rules for Flutter apps.

Run linting by running `flutter analyze` command in the root of the project or integrate linter with your IDE.

### Formatting

To format the code use `flutter format lib/` or `flutter format test/` command in the root of a project.

#### Usage with VS Code

Linting can be easily integrated via [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) extension.

With this extension, you can find analysis issues in the **Problems** tab:

> To see issues next to affected line use [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) extension.

##### Auto-formatting on file save

Enable automatic code formatting on each file save by settings `Manage (Bottom left cog icon) ‚û° Settings`, then search for _Editor: Format On Save_ and enable the checkbox:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment variables (flavors)

This template supports flavoring via environment variables passed to `flutter build/run` commands.

Variables are available to other modules in `lib/src/environment/variables.dart` and any new ones should be added there.

### Adding environment variables

Each variable should have an `APP_` prefix to avoid accidental overriding of other tool variables.

To add a new variable:

1. Add a new `--dart-define=APP_VARIABLE=value` parameter to `flutter build/run` command or `.vscode/launch.json`, like so:

```shell
flutter run --dart-define=APP_VARIABLE=value
```

2. Handle the variable in the code. In `lib/src/environment/variables.dart` add a new field that will read value from environment, like so:

```dart
class EnvironmentVariables {
  // ...
  static const String appVariable = String.fromEnvironment('APP_VARIABLE', defaultValue: 'default');
  // ...
}
```

3. (Optional) Handle the value in Android build process. Head to `android/app/build.gradle` and add your variable to `dartEnvironmentVariables`, like so:

```gradle
def dartEnvironmentVariables = [
    // ...
    APP_VARIABLE: 'default'
    // ...
];
```

4. (Optional) Handle the value in iOS build process. New variables will be automatically available for use in Xcode (as long as those are prefixed with `APP_`).

### Adding environments

To create new environment:

1. Create new file with variables in `environment/` directory.
2. Include new variables file in `Makefile`.
3. Create build scripts for the new flavor.

Also, for VS Code:

1. Open `.vscode/launch.json`.
2. Create _debug_ and _profile_ launch modes with new environment variables.

## üß≠ Routing

By default [Routemaster](https://pub.dev/packages/routemaster) is used as route management. it provides us opportunity to easily send params to our routes.

To create some route without params:

1. Define path as a static constant
```dart
  static const main = '/';
```
2. Add pair of your path and widget to routes map
```dart
RouteMap(
  routes: {
    main: (_) => const MaterialPage(child: TheScreenWidget()),
    },
  );
```

To create route with some parameter:

1. Define path as static method that has named parameters.
```dart
  static String cubitRoute({String? title}) => '/cubit/${title ?? ':title'}';
```
2. Add pair to routes map
```dart
RouteMap(
  routes: {
    // Defined path is '/cubit/:title'
    cubitRoute(): (info) => MaterialPage(
      child: CubitView(
        title: info.pathParameters['title'],
        ),
      ),
    },
  );
```

To send some parameters to the screen:
```dart
Routemaster.of(context).push(Routes.cubitRoute('BLoC'));
```

You also can use your route without parameters, in this case, the provided value will be `null`

## üìà Sentry

After creating Sentry project just pass the DSN to `--dart-define=SENTRY_DSN=value` in `.vscode/launch.json` or when running a `flutter run/build` commands.

[Sentry docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/flutter/)

## üìÜ Changelog

Each app version should have brief notes for introduced changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## üè≠ Building the app

There is a `Makefile` with build scripts for _dev_ and _prod_ environment (those are standard `flutter build *` commands but with environment variables).

Eg. to build _dev_ `.apk` run `make build-dev-apk`. For iOS there're `*-ipa`, and for web there're `*-web` scripts.

## üèéüí® CD with AppCenter

We're using custom scripts to make [AppCenter](https://appcenter.ms/) support our app building process.

There's one for Android (`android/app/appcenter-post-clone.sh`) and one for iOS (`ios/appcenter-post-clone.sh`). Those download Flutter, build _prod_ flavored app with signing
and distributes it.

### Android setup

Firstly, create a keystore for signing.

You need to have [Java installed](https://openjdk.java.net/) and available in the shell:

- on mac, using [brew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install openjdk`,
- on windows, just download a `.msi` file [from here](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk),
- on linux or wsl, there's probably `openjdk` available in your package manager.

In the root project folder run: `make create-android-signing`.
You will be asked some questions, but the passwords are the most important. Remember those and put
in `android/app/build.gradle` in section `signingConfigs`:

```gradle
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile rootProject.file("upload-keystore.jks") # leave as-is
        storePassword "password" # put your store password here
        keyAlias "upload" # leave as-is
        keyPassword "password" # put your key password here
    }
}
```

To check if signing works, you can run `make build-prod-apk`. If the build process goes fine
and the app is working it's done üçæ

#### AppCenter Android setup

To use signing in Android builds, set the AppCenter build like so:

> To distribute the app automatically to the store, follow [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/stores/googleplay).
